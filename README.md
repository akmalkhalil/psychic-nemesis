<b><u>blackjack and other card games</u></b>

<p>blackjack game i've spent my christmas holidays creating<br/>
in my version in import a class i've created called <i>Deck</i> which can do a couple of other useless things to the class in the program</p>

<b>todo:</b>
<ul>
<li>add GUI</li>
<li>images for cards?</li>
<li>get a life</li>
<li>play across LAN (purple dinosaur's working on this)</li>
<li> play over the internet </li> 
</ul>
<br/>
<p>come up with another game to make. once i've done the GUI, i won't have much left for blackjack<br/>
thought bout doing battleships but maybe not in psychic nemisis, i'm keeping this for card games<br/>
friends have said to do solitaire <br/>
thought about doing go fish becuase it's simple <br/>
maybe rummy <br/>
